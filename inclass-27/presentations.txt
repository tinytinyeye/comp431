1. Progressive Web Apps was the one that was the most polished and delivered.
The reason is that compared with other slides, the use of Prezi creates lots
of cool visual effects and attract audiences attentions. The layout of the
materials are also pretty decent so that each slide will not contain too much
text.

2. The topic I learned most from is Java Spring MVC because this semester I was
mostly dealing with Java and MVC and I used Spark in Java in my previous class
before. Compared with Javascript, since Java Spring MVC is based on Java, it
is type-safe and may achieves higher performance. The addition of annotations
also simplifies the development process. I learnt that for a larger-scale
enterprise-level web application, since Java Spring MVC handles both the frontend
and backend and decouples them with MVC architecture, it will be easier to
manage.

3. My favorite talk is Hybrid Mobile Apps. The reason is that hybrid mobile
app is more and more popular right now. Apps like Instagram and Yelp are
actually a combination of a native container and a web view. Before listening
to this talk, I thought all the elements of these apps are native. However,
they are actually hybrid and works perfectly across different platforms. It
is good to hear that in the future I may be able to write mobile apps in
Javascript and combine some of the native functions such as push notifications
like what the talk said.
