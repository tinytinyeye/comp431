1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

I think the Vue.js one was the most polished and delivered. Since it clearly
showed the difference between Vue.js and React.js, presented pros and cons
of both library and emphasize one of the best part in Vue.js is optimized
partial update for specific web components. The talk is smooth and compact.
The slides were also informational while did not contain too much texts.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

I think the one I learnt most from is Web Crawler because I was interested in
this topic before but have no idea how to start or what kind of software I
should use. Since Web Crawling is a key technology in data-mining and big-data
analysis, understanding these basic concepts and know some of the popular
frameworks help me getting started in this area. From this talk I learned some
basic concepts about Web Crawling, the limitation of web crawling for ajax
rendered pages and the solution for it and a popular framework of web crawling
Scrapy.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?

The talk I like the best is D3. The talk itself is pretty concise and deliver
contents the relationship between data and visual rendering effectively. D3
as a tool to present data, it separates the concern of view and model so that
developers or designers can focus on how to present the given data in a better
way or in a more visualized way. The speaker also mentions the application of
D3 in big data and that makes me wondering in the future, in news industry,
D3 may be widely use to present data-based fact and inform the public more
effectively, with real data.
