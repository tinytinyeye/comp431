Actually I did not know what I will learn in this class but at the end I have
learned a lot. I really enjoy learning React and Redux. The philosophy behind
the combination of React and Redux even affects my thinking of software
development in other classes. I struggled a lot when I started learning React
and Redux, but as I understood what is going on between the components and
the Redux store, the development process speeds up a lot. I think the best part
of this class is in-class exercise. It really helped me understand some of the
concepts just taught in class. But since the difficulty between in-class
exercise vary greatly, some of them may take much longer time to finish than
others. For example, exercises such as the javascript game paint exercise and
React-related javascript exercises are pretty hard. When I do the hw5, I did
lots of research in react and redux to understand how the dispatch and connect
works. Since the in-class exercise is more like fill in the blanks, they did not
teach us what these functions are and how they work. If we can have a diagram
that explains the data flow of redux and react, it will be really helpful. But
in the same time, I learned a lot by doing the searching by myself. Since the
most difficult part of homework is the front-end homework, I hope in the future
there are more lectures and details explaining how Redux and React work together.
Sometimes video tutorial is not enough. Lastly, thank you for providing such
a wonderful class!
